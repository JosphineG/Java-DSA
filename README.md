# Java-DSA- a Java code using linked list concept to create a stack and a queue and calculate their time complexity 

## Time Complexity

 Time complexity of queue operations: O(1) for enqueue, O(n) for dequeue (n is the size of the queue)

Time complexity of stack operations: O(1) or constant time because all the operations involve only accessing or modifying the first element of the linked list
